RC4 Cipher in ANSI C99 (With some optimization)
===============================================

![RC4 Logo](https://gitlab.com/Neo_Chen/RC4/raw/master/Logo.png "Yes, it has a logo")  
Just a simple tool for an absolutely insecure encryption scheme.  
**WARNING!** This algorithm is obsolete. Do not use it to encrypt any sensitive data. (Though it might be a good scrambler to hide repeated 0's)

## Note

This implementation is written in ANSI C99 (C89 also works, but there will be no inline) and should be portable (I guess).
