Neo_Chen's RC4 Cipher Implementation
====================================

![RC4 Logo](https://gitlab.com/Neo_Chen/RC4/raw/master/Logo.png "Yes, it has a logo")  
Just a simple tool for **absolutely unsecure** encryption.  
**WARNING!** This algorithm is completely outdated, do not use it to encrypt any sensitive data. (Might be a good scrambler to reduce repeated 0's though)

## Note

This implementation is written with ANSI C99 (C89 if there's no inline), it should be portable (I guess)
