NeoCrypt: A Few Algorithms in ANSI C
====================================

![NeoCrypt](https://gitlab.com/Neo_Chen/RC4/raw/master/Logo.png "Yes, it has a logo")  
Just a simple tool for an absolutely insecure encryption scheme.  
**WARNING!** RC4 algorithm is obsolete, and being effected by distinguishing attack.
Do not use it to encrypt any sensitive data.

## Note
This implementation is written in ANSI C with POSIX.1 C library and should be portable (I guess).
